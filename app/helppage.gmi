# Gemini Web Browser -- Help Page 
 
There are 3 main screens of the application.
 
1 The Browser
* It has 2 main sub-components. Only one can be in focus at a time. Press the <TAB> button to toggle between them.
* Search field        --> Enter urls to request pages. \"home\" for the home-screen. Press <ENTER>.
* Content display     --> See rendered Gemtext content of requested page.
 
2 The Help Page (Where you are now!)
 
3 The History Page
* A chronological stack of visited pages. No fancy handling. All pages are added, even if the request fails.
* You can revisit pages in the stack by pressing <ENTER>.
